# Keylogger-
Keylogger i made in c++. Used the Windows API GetAsyncKeyState to get keyboard input. Used ToAscii and GetKeyboardState for character conversion even using special characters such as space and shift. 
Create a txt file names text to save the keystrokes to a file. 
Only runs on Windows for now since it uses Windows APIs.
